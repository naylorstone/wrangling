    "1. This paper is about an organizational framework for cleaning data sets, that allows for easier data analysis. This framework turns columns into variables and rows into individual observations and each observational unit is a table.\n",
    "2. The author makes the point that despite data analytics's monumental importance in most recent studies, the actual cleaning of data is something that is often taken for granted or just not thought about. The \"tidy  data standard\" aims to standardize data cleaning through outlining the steps and most efficient ways to clean data that can then be readily used in analysis. \n",
    "3. The first sentence talks about how messy data sets can have a variety of problems (and sometimes no two alike) that make data analysis quite difficult. Tidy datasets, on the other hand, all have similar properties and can be delt with more broadly. The second sentence talks about how in data sets, it can be simply stated that the rows are observations and the columns are variables. But the actual choice to define the data in such a way doesn't have as clear of an indicator. \n",
    "4. A value is is what makes up a dataset and is usually a number or string. Values are organized into variables, which contain all values that measure the same thing, and observations, which contain all values measured to teh same unit. \n",
    "5. A tidy data set is a set in which each variable is a column, each observation is a row and each type of observational unit is a table. \n",
    "6. The 5 most common problems are column headers as values and not variable names, multiple varaibles stored in one column, variables stored in rows and columns, multiple types of observations in the same table, and single oberservations stored across multiple tables. The data in table 4 is messy since the columns are currently values of the variable of income, which should have its own column with its values. Melting a data set is taking columns that contain values of another variable and turning them into rows of that variable's column. \n",
    "7. Table 11 has values as columns (the different days) while Table 12 \"melts\" the data as it makes those days the values of the variable \"date\".\n",
    "8. The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem exists in tidy data is the author says that tidy data will always be linked with tidy tools as long as tidy data is \"only as useful\" as its tools. Wickham hopes that tidy data becomes a larger movement that is committed to a better system of data cleaning and organization"

    "2. This data is gathered in large part so that the federal government can see economic, social, and polical information across different races. This information can play a large part in how the government decides to give out aid, monitors voting activity (and therefore individual parties act accordingly during elections), how to write other types of policy. Data quality matters as this information is used in many ways as stated above with actual effects to the lives of citizens in the United States.\n",
    "3. The census has done well in increasing the number of options in races and allowing multiple to be selected as it reflects the diverse identities across the US. While the racial categories are an improvement, the Census should aim at allowing the selection of different ethnicities (like different ethnicities in Asia) so that citizens can give a better view at their backgrounds. Perhaps integrating questions on race and ethnicity to get a more holistic view of the backgrounds of those filling out the servey would be a good practice for any larg scal surveys. I think the Census' good practices could be adopted more widely with the greater options helping with greater participation. \n",
    "4. For sex, the Census only allows two options (male and female) with no further options for specifying gender beyond. This could lead to decreased participation with those who fill out the survey may feel that they cannot show their true identities with such binary options.\n",
    "5. Th only concerns I have is ensuring the data accurately reflects those in the survey so that certain groups are not misrepresented, which would have major reprocussions. Missing values could lead to biases in decision making when using the Census data. People might adopt the bad practices of omitting and not account data with missing values. \n",
    "6. I would be concerned with any sort of biases that the algorithm might have within. "
